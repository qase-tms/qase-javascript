Feature: Cucumber documentation
    As a user of cucumber.js
    I want to have documentation on cucumber
    So I can write better applications

    @sections
    Scenario: Usage documentation
        Given I am on the cucumber.js GitHub repository
        When I go to the README file
#        Then I should see a "Cool" section
#        When I go to the README file
