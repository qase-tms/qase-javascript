## How to integrate

```
npm install playwright-qase-reporter
```


## Example of usage

If you want to decorate cake test with Qase case Id you could use case function. The Id in your test must be entered in accordance with the hierarchy of test case Ids in your TMS Qase. For example:

```typescript
import { qase } from 'playwright-qase-reporter/dist/playwright';

describe('Test suite', () => {
    test(qase([1,2], 'Several ids'), () => {
        expect(true).toBe(true);
    })

    test(qase(3, 'Correct test'), () => {
        expect(true).toBe(true);
    })

    test.skip(qase("4", 'Skipped test'), () => {
        expect(true).toBe(true);
    })

    test(qase(["5", "6"], 'Failed test'), () => {
        expect(true).toBe(false);
    })
});

```

To run tests and create a test run, execute the command::
```
QASE_REPORT=1 npx playwright test
```

A test run will be performed and available at:
```
https://app.qase.io/run/QASE_PROJECT_CODE
```
## Configuration

Reporter options (* - required):

- *`apiToken` - Token for API access, you can find more information
  [here](https://developers.qase.io/#authentication)
- *`projectCode` - Code of your project (can be extracted from main 
  page of your project: `https://app.qase.io/project/DEMOTR` - 
  `DEMOTR` is project code here)
- `runId` - Run ID from Qase TMS (also can be got from run URL)
- `environmentId` - Environment ID from Qase TMS
- `logging` [true/false] - Enabled debug logging from reporter or not
- `runComplete` [true/false] - Complete run after all tests are finished
- `uploadAttachments` [true/false] - Uploading attachments (screenshot/video) after test ended

Example `playwright.config.js` config:

```js
const config = {
    use: {
        screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
        video: 'retain-on-failure',
    },
    reporter: [
        ['list'],
        ['playwright-qase-reporter',
            {
                apiToken: 'api_key',
                projectCode: 'project_code',
                runComplete: true,
                logging: true,
                uploadAttachments: true,
            }],
    ],
};
module.exports = config;
```

You can check example configuration with multiple reporters in [example project](./examples/playwright.config.js).
