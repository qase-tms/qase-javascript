Added the ability to specify a test metadata in tests:

- `qase.suite` - set the test suite
- `qase.comment` - set the test comment
- `qase.parameters` - set the test parameters
- `qase.groupParameters` - set the test group parameters
- `qase.ignore` - ignore the test in Qase
- `qase.attach` - attach a file to the test
- `qase.steps` - add the test steps

```ts
const { qase } = require('jest-qase-reporter/jest');

test('test', () => {
  qase.title('Title');
  qase.fields({ custom_field: 'value' });
  qase.suite('Suite');
  qase.comment('Comment');
  qase.parameters({ param01: 'value' });
  qase.groupParameters({ param02: 'value' });
  qase.ignore();
  qase.attach({ name: 'attachment.txt', content: 'Hello, world!', type: 'text/plain' });

  qase.step('Step 1', () => {
    expect(true).toBe(true);
  });

  expect(true).toBe(true);
});
