# [Qase TestOps](https://qase.io) reporters for JavaScript

Monorepo with [Qase TestOps](https://qase.io) reporters for JavaScript testing frameworks.

For all of our reporters, there is the old and reliable v1 series and the new and experimental v2 series.
If you're just starting, pick v2.

What each status means:

* The "âœ… released" reporters are stable and well-tested versions.
  They will receive more new features as well as bugfixes, should we find bugs.

* The "ğŸ§ª open beta" reporters are in active development and rigorous testing.
  It's completely usable (and much more fun to use than v1), but there can be some bugs and minor syntax changes.
  When starting a new test project, the "ğŸ§ª open beta" versions are the recommended choice.
  For existing projects, we recommend planning a migration â€” see the migration section in each
  reporter's readme and try out the new features.

* The "ğŸ§° closed beta" reporters are in active development, and
  can still have major bugs and future syntax changes.
  However, we encourage experimenting with them.
  Your feedback is always welcome.

* The v1 series reporters in the "ğŸ—¿stable" or "ğŸ—¿deprecated" status only get some fixes, but no new features.
