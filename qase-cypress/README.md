# Qase TMS Cypress reporter

Publish results simple and easy.

> ðŸ—¿This readme is for the Cypress reporter v1, which is no longer supported.
> [Check out the newer version 2](https://github.com/qase-tms/qase-javascript/tree/main/qase-cypress#readme).

To install the Cypress reporter v1, run:

```sh
npm install -D cypress-qase-reporter@1.4.3
```

## Example of usage

In order to connect Qase tests with your automated JavaScript tests you need to pass your `testId` and the test itself to the `qase` function.
You can see example usage with [CypressJS](https://docs.qase.io/documentation/general/get-started-with-the-qase-platform/create-a-test-run#quick-test-case) tests:

```typescript
import { qase } from 'cypress-qase-reporter/dist/mocha';
const testId = 1

describe('My First Test', () => {
    qase(testId,
        it('Correct test', () => {
            expect(true).to.equal(true);
        })
    );
});

```
You can also pass testId to a list if the automated test corresponds to multiple of you test cases in Qase:
```typescript
import { qase } from 'cypress-qase-reporter/dist/mocha';

describe('My First Test', () => {
    qase([1,4,9],
        it('Correct test', () => {
            expect(true).to.equal(true);
        })
    );
});
```

If you are going to use several specifications for execution and you have in config

```bash
"runComplete": true
```
then it is necessary to additionally set in the [project settings](https://docs.qase.io/documentation/general/get-started-with-the-qase-platform/create-a-project/project-settings) the following option:

```
Allow to add results for cases in closed runs.
```

To run tests and create a test run, execute the command (for example from folder examples):
```bash
QASE_REPORT=1 npx cypress run
```
or
```bash
npm test
```

A test run will be performed and available at:
