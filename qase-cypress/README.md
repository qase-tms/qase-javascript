## How to integrate

```
npm install cypress-qase-reporter
```

## Example of usage

If you want to decorate come test with Qase Case ID you could use qase function:

```typescript
import { qase } from 'cypress-qase-reporter/dist/mocha';

describe('My First Test', () => {
    qase([1,2],
        it('Several ids', () => {
            expect(true).to.equal(true);
        })
    );
    qase(3,
        it('Correct test', () => {
            expect(true).to.equal(true);
        })
    );
    qase(4,
        it.skip('Skipped test', () => {
            expect(true).to.equal(true);
        })
    );
    qase(5,
        it('Failed test', () => {
            expect(true).to.equal(false);
        })
    );
});

```
You should also have an active item in the project settings at
```
https://app.qase.io/project/QASE_PROJECT_CODE/settings/options
```
option in the `Test Runs` block:
```
Allow submitting results in bulk
```
If you are going to use several specifications for execution and you have in config 
```bash
"runComplete": true
```
then it is necessary to additionally set in the project settings
```
Allow to add results for cases in closed runs.
```

To run tests and create a test run, execute the command (for example from folder examples):
```bash
QASE_REPORT=1 npx cypress run
```
or
```bash
npm test
```

A test run will be performed and available at:

```
https://app.qase.io/run/QASE_PROJECT_CODE
```
