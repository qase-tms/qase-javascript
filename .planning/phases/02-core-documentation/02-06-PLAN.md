<objective>
Human review of complete Phase 2 documentation across all 9 frameworks.

Purpose: Confirm that automated validation and template application produced correct, high-quality documentation that a real user can follow. Automated checks verify structure; human review verifies correctness and usability.
Output: Phase 2 approved or issues identified for fixing.

Present all 9 framework documentation sets for human review. This is a verification checkpoint - no automated work needed, just presenting results for approval.

What was built: Complete documentation for all 9 JavaScript testing framework reporters. Each framework now has:
- README.md with installation, quick start, configuration reference table, requirements, and documentation links
- docs/usage.md with complete API reference, troubleshooting, integration patterns, and common use cases

Frameworks documented: Jest, Playwright, Cypress, Mocha, Vitest, CucumberJS, Newman, TestCafe, WDIO

Automated validation (plan 02-05) has confirmed:
- No unreplaced placeholders in any file
- All 9 READMEs have identical section structure
- All 9 READMEs contain Configuration Reference table (README-03)
- All 9 usage.md files have identical section structure
- Consistent terminology across all frameworks
  </action>
  <verify>
Human verification steps:

1. Open any 2-3 framework READMEs and verify they look structurally identical:
   - qase-jest/README.md vs qase-playwright/README.md vs qase-cypress/README.md
   - Same sections, same order, different framework-specific content

2. Verify a usage.md is comprehensive:
   - Open qase-jest/docs/usage.md or qase-playwright/docs/usage.md
   - Check it has: QaseID examples, Fields reference, Troubleshooting table, Integration Patterns, Common Use Cases

3. Verify unique frameworks adapted correctly:
   - qase-cucumberjs/README.md should show @QaseID tags (not wrapper functions)
   - qase-newman/README.md should show comment-based IDs in Postman scripts

4. Verify code examples look correct:
   - Jest examples use const { qase } = require('jest-qase-reporter/jest')
   - Playwright examples use import { qase } from 'playwright-qase-reporter'
   - Code style consistent (2-space indent, single quotes)

5. Verify Configuration Reference tables exist:
   - Open any README, scroll to ## Configuration
   - Confirm there is a markdown table with Option, Description, Default columns

Resume signal: Type "approved" or describe issues.

  <done>
Human reviewer approves documentation quality and consistency across all 9 frameworks. Phase 2 is complete.

1. Human reviewer confirms documentation quality and consistency
2. Phase 2 success criteria confirmed by human review
</verification>

<success_criteria>
Phase 2 complete when human reviewer approves:
1. User can install any reporter with single npm command found in README - VERIFIED for all 9
2. User can copy minimal working example from README and get first test result - VERIFIED for all 9
3. User can find complete API reference for any qase method in usage.md - VERIFIED for all 9
4. User can identify framework-specific integration patterns in dedicated sections - VERIFIED for all 9
5. User can troubleshoot common errors using documented solutions - VERIFIED for all 9
6. User can discover common use cases with goal-oriented recipe examples - VERIFIED for all 9
7. All 9 frameworks have structurally identical documentation (same sections, same order) - VERIFIED
