<objective>
Apply master documentation templates to Jest and Playwright reporters, creating complete README.md and docs/usage.md for both frameworks.

Purpose: Jest and Playwright are the two most popular frameworks in this project with the most complete existing documentation. They serve as reference implementations for the remaining 7 frameworks.
Output: 4 files (README.md + usage.md for each framework), all placeholders replaced, validated.

  <name>Task 1: Apply templates to Jest reporter (README.md + usage.md)</name>
  <files>qase-jest/README.md, qase-jest/docs/usage.md</files>
  <action>
Apply master templates to create complete Jest documentation. Follow the 8-step workflow from TEMPLATE-USAGE-GUIDE.md.

**README.md:**
1. Start from README-TEMPLATE.md structure
2. Read the EXISTING qase-jest/README.md first to preserve any Jest-specific content (e.g., Puppeteer/Appium/Detox compatibility note, jest.config.ts reporter configuration)
3. Replace all placeholders using values from FRAMEWORK-VARIATIONS.md and PLACEHOLDER-REFERENCE.md:
   - {{FRAMEWORK_NAME}} = Jest
   - {{PACKAGE_NAME}} = jest-qase-reporter
   - {{FRAMEWORK_VERSION}} = 27.0.0
   - {{CONFIG_LOCATION}} = jest.config.ts (or jest.config.js)
   - {{RUN_COMMAND}} = npx jest
   - {{QUICK_START_TEST_EXAMPLE}} = Jest wrapper pattern: `const { qase } = require('jest-qase-reporter/jest'); test(qase(1, 'Test name'), () => { ... });`
   - {{LINK_TESTS_EXAMPLE}} = Single ID and multiple IDs examples with Jest test() syntax
   - {{METADATA_EXAMPLE}} = qase.fields(), qase.suite(), qase.title() inside test()
   - {{IGNORE_EXAMPLE}} = qase.ignore() inside test()
   - {{STATUS_TABLE}} = Pass/Fail/Skip status mapping for Jest
   - {{RUNNING_TESTS_EXAMPLES}} = npx jest, npx jest --testPathPattern, environment variables
4. Keep the existing Jest-specific note about Puppeteer/Appium/Detox compatibility
5. Follow CODE-STYLE-GUIDE.md: 2-space indent, single quotes, const { qase } = require(...) for CommonJS examples
6. Ensure Documentation links table points to docs/usage.md, docs/ATTACHMENTS.md, docs/STEPS.md, docs/MULTI_PROJECT.md, docs/UPGRADE.md

**usage.md:**
1. Start from usage-TEMPLATE.md structure
2. Read the EXISTING qase-jest/docs/usage.md to preserve any Jest-specific patterns and ensure no regression
3. Replace all placeholders with Jest-specific code examples:
   - All QaseID examples use `test(qase(id, 'name'), () => {})` wrapper pattern
   - Import: `const { qase } = require('jest-qase-reporter/jest');`
   - Steps use async pattern: `await qase.step('name', async () => {})`
   - Attachments use `qase.attach({ paths: [...] })` and `qase.attach({ content: '...', contentType: '...' })`
   - Parameters show Jest test.each integration
   - Troubleshooting includes Jest-specific errors (jest.config.ts reporter array format, module resolution)
4. Add Integration Patterns section (USAGE-02): Jest lifecycle hooks (beforeAll/afterAll), test.each parameterization, Jest config reporter options
5. Add Common Use Cases / Recipes section (USAGE-04): 5-10 goal-oriented examples (e.g., "Report a smoke test suite", "Attach screenshot on failure", "Use with Puppeteer", "Run subset with Qase test plan")
6. Ensure all internal links work (Table of Contents, cross-references to ATTACHMENTS.md, STEPS.md, MULTI_PROJECT.md)

**Validation:**
Run `node .planning/tools/validate-placeholders.js qase-jest/README.md` and `node .planning/tools/validate-placeholders.js qase-jest/docs/usage.md` - both must exit 0.

  <verify>
node .planning/tools/validate-placeholders.js qase-jest/README.md && node .planning/tools/validate-placeholders.js qase-jest/docs/usage.md && echo "Jest validation passed"
  </verify>
  <done>
Jest README.md has: installation command, 3-step quick start with working example, configuration reference table, requirements section, documentation links table. Jest usage.md has: complete QaseID examples (single/multiple), all qase.* methods documented with parameters/types/examples, troubleshooting table with 5+ common errors, integration patterns section with 3+ patterns, common use cases section with 5+ recipes. No unreplaced {{PLACEHOLDER}} patterns remain.

  <name>Task 2: Apply templates to Playwright reporter (README.md + usage.md)</name>
  <files>qase-playwright/README.md, qase-playwright/docs/usage.md</files>
  <action>
Apply master templates to create complete Playwright documentation. Follow the 8-step workflow from TEMPLATE-USAGE-GUIDE.md.

**README.md:**
1. Start from README-TEMPLATE.md structure
2. Read the EXISTING qase-playwright/README.md first to preserve Playwright-specific content (e.g., playwright.config.ts reporter configuration, multiple test ID linking options)
3. Replace all placeholders:
   - {{FRAMEWORK_NAME}} = Playwright
   - {{PACKAGE_NAME}} = playwright-qase-reporter
   - {{FRAMEWORK_VERSION}} = 1.20.0
   - {{CONFIG_LOCATION}} = playwright.config.ts
   - {{RUN_COMMAND}} = npx playwright test
   - {{QUICK_START_TEST_EXAMPLE}} = Show BOTH patterns: wrapper `test(qase(1, 'name'), ...)` AND method-based `test('name', () => { qase.title('name'); ... })`
   - {{LINK_TESTS_EXAMPLE}} = Both wrapper and method patterns, single and multiple IDs
   - {{METADATA_EXAMPLE}} = qase.fields(), qase.suite(), qase.title() - show method-based pattern (Playwright's more common style)
   - {{IGNORE_EXAMPLE}} = qase.ignore()
   - {{STATUS_TABLE}} = Pass/Fail/TimedOut/Skipped mapping for Playwright
   - {{RUNNING_TESTS_EXAMPLES}} = npx playwright test, npx playwright test --project, --grep, environment variables
4. Highlight Playwright's unique dual pattern (wrapper function vs method-based) prominently
5. Follow CODE-STYLE-GUIDE.md: use TypeScript syntax for Playwright (import { qase } from 'playwright-qase-reporter'), 2-space indent
6. Show playwright.config.ts reporter configuration with reporter array format

**usage.md:**
1. Start from usage-TEMPLATE.md structure
2. Read the EXISTING qase-playwright/docs/usage.md to preserve Playwright-specific patterns
3. Replace all placeholders with Playwright-specific examples:
   - QaseID examples show BOTH wrapper and method patterns
   - Import: `import { qase } from 'playwright-qase-reporter';` (ESM)
   - Steps use async pattern: `await qase.step('name', async () => {})`
   - Attachments include Playwright-specific screenshot attachment: `await page.screenshot()` + `qase.attach()`
   - Parameters show Playwright test parameterization with projects/test.describe
   - Troubleshooting includes Playwright-specific errors (config format, fixture integration, parallel execution reporting)
4. Add Integration Patterns section: Playwright test fixtures, Page Object pattern with Qase, browser context handling, parallel test reporting, project-based test organization
5. Add Common Use Cases / Recipes section: 5-10 examples (e.g., "Attach screenshot on failure", "Report visual comparison results", "Use with multiple browsers", "Group by test.describe as Qase suite")
6. Ensure all internal links work

**Validation:**
Run validate-placeholders.js on both files - must exit 0.

Playwright README.md has: installation command, quick start showing both wrapper and method patterns, playwright.config.ts reporter setup, configuration reference, requirements, documentation links. Playwright usage.md has: both ID linking patterns documented, all qase.* methods with TypeScript examples, Playwright-specific troubleshooting (5+ errors), integration patterns (fixtures, parallel, projects), common use cases (5+ recipes). No unreplaced {{PLACEHOLDER}} patterns remain.
