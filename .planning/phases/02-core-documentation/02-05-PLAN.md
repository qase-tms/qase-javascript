<objective>
Cross-validate all 9 framework documentation files for structural consistency, fix any deviations, and verify phase success criteria through automated validation and human review.

Purpose: Ensures all 9 frameworks have structurally identical documentation meeting all Phase 2 requirements (README-01 through FW-09). Catches inconsistencies that individual plans may have introduced.
Output: All 18 files validated and consistent, phase success criteria confirmed.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Cross-validate structural consistency across all 9 frameworks</name>
  <files>All 18 README.md and docs/usage.md files (modifications only if inconsistencies found)</files>
  <action>
Perform automated cross-validation of all 9 framework documentation files.

**Step 1: Placeholder validation (all frameworks)**
Run validate-placeholders.js on each framework directory:
```bash
for dir in qase-jest qase-playwright qase-cypress qase-mocha qase-vitest qase-cucumberjs qase-newman qase-testcafe qase-wdio; do
  node .planning/tools/validate-placeholders.js "$dir/"
done
```
All must exit 0. If any fail, fix the unreplaced placeholders.

**Step 2: Structural consistency check (README.md)**
Verify all 9 READMEs contain these required sections in this order:
1. Title with "Qase TestOps" and framework name
2. Features section (## Features)
3. Installation section (## Installation) with `npm install --save-dev` command
4. Quick Start section (## Quick Start) with numbered steps
5. Configuration section (## Configuration) with priority list and table
6. Usage section (## Usage) with test linking examples
7. Running Tests section (## Running Tests)
8. Requirements section (## Requirements) with Node.js and framework version
9. Documentation section (## Documentation) with links table
10. License section (## License)

For each README, grep for each section heading. Report any missing sections.
Fix missing sections by adding them following the template structure.

**Step 3: Structural consistency check (usage.md)**
Verify all 9 usage.md files contain these required sections:
1. Title and intro
2. Table of Contents
3. Adding QaseID (## Adding QaseID)
4. Adding Title (## Adding Title)
5. Adding Fields (## Adding Fields) with system fields table
6. Adding Suite (## Adding Suite)
7. Ignoring Tests (## Ignoring Tests)
8. Muting Tests (## Muting Tests)
9. Working with Attachments (## Working with Attachments)
10. Working with Steps (## Working with Steps)
11. Working with Parameters (## Working with Parameters)
12. Running Tests (## Running Tests)
13. Complete Examples (## Complete Examples)
14. Troubleshooting (## Troubleshooting)
15. Integration Patterns (visible section for framework-specific patterns)
16. Common Use Cases (visible section with recipes)

For non-standard frameworks (Newman, CucumberJS), sections may be adapted but should still be present (even if noting "not applicable").

**Step 4: Cross-framework consistency fixes**
- Ensure all configuration tables use same column names
- Ensure all status tables have same format
- Ensure all documentation link tables point to same set of guides
- Fix any terminology inconsistencies (e.g., "test case ID" vs "QaseID" - use "QaseID" consistently)

**Step 5: Link validation**
Verify all internal links resolve:
- README.md links to docs/usage.md (must exist)
- README.md links to docs/ATTACHMENTS.md, docs/STEPS.md, docs/MULTI_PROJECT.md, docs/UPGRADE.md (may not exist yet - that's Phase 3, but links should be correct paths)
- usage.md links to ATTACHMENTS.md, STEPS.md, MULTI_PROJECT.md (relative paths)
  </action>
  <verify>
Run validation across all 9 frameworks and verify structural consistency:
```bash
# Placeholder check
for dir in qase-jest qase-playwright qase-cypress qase-mocha qase-vitest qase-cucumberjs qase-newman qase-testcafe qase-wdio; do
  node .planning/tools/validate-placeholders.js "$dir/" || echo "FAIL: $dir"
done

# Section check (README)
for dir in qase-jest qase-playwright qase-cypress qase-mocha qase-vitest qase-cucumberjs qase-newman qase-testcafe qase-wdio; do
  echo "=== $dir README ==="
  grep -c "## Installation\|## Quick Start\|## Configuration\|## Requirements\|## Documentation" "$dir/README.md"
done

# Section check (usage.md)
for dir in qase-jest qase-playwright qase-cypress qase-mocha qase-vitest qase-cucumberjs qase-newman qase-testcafe qase-wdio; do
  echo "=== $dir usage.md ==="
  grep -c "## Adding QaseID\|## Adding Fields\|## Troubleshooting" "$dir/docs/usage.md"
done
```
  </verify>
  <done>
All 9 frameworks pass placeholder validation (exit 0). All 9 READMEs have all required sections in correct order. All 9 usage.md files have all required sections. Terminology is consistent across all frameworks. Internal links use correct relative paths.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 2: Human review of complete Phase 2 documentation</name>
  <action>
Present all 9 framework documentation sets for human review. This is a verification checkpoint - no automated work needed, just presenting results for approval.

What was built: Complete documentation for all 9 JavaScript testing framework reporters. Each framework now has:
- README.md with installation, quick start, configuration reference, requirements, and documentation links
- docs/usage.md with complete API reference, troubleshooting, integration patterns, and common use cases

Frameworks documented: Jest, Playwright, Cypress, Mocha, Vitest, CucumberJS, Newman, TestCafe, WDIO
  </action>
  <verify>
Human verification steps:
1. Open any 2-3 framework READMEs and verify they look structurally identical:
   - qase-jest/README.md vs qase-playwright/README.md vs qase-cypress/README.md
   - Same sections, same order, different framework-specific content

2. Verify a usage.md is comprehensive:
   - Open qase-jest/docs/usage.md or qase-playwright/docs/usage.md
   - Check it has: QaseID examples, Fields reference, Troubleshooting table, Integration Patterns, Common Use Cases

3. Verify unique frameworks adapted correctly:
   - qase-cucumberjs/README.md should show @QaseID tags (not wrapper functions)
   - qase-newman/README.md should show comment-based IDs in Postman scripts

4. Verify code examples look correct:
   - Jest examples use const { qase } = require('jest-qase-reporter/jest')
   - Playwright examples use import { qase } from 'playwright-qase-reporter'
   - Code style consistent (2-space indent, single quotes)
  </verify>
  <done>
Human reviewer approves documentation quality and consistency across all 9 frameworks. Phase 2 is complete.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. All 9 framework directories pass `node .planning/tools/validate-placeholders.js` with exit 0
2. All 9 READMEs have identical section structure
3. All 9 usage.md files have identical section structure (adapted for BDD/Postman where needed)
4. Human reviewer confirms documentation quality and consistency
</verification>

<success_criteria>
Phase 2 success criteria (from ROADMAP.md):
1. User can install any reporter with single npm command found in README - VERIFIED for all 9
2. User can copy minimal working example from README and get first test result - VERIFIED for all 9
3. User can find complete API reference for any qase method in usage.md - VERIFIED for all 9
4. User can identify framework-specific integration patterns in dedicated sections - VERIFIED for all 9
5. User can troubleshoot common errors using documented solutions - VERIFIED for all 9
6. User can discover common use cases with goal-oriented recipe examples - VERIFIED for all 9
7. All 9 frameworks have structurally identical documentation (same sections, same order) - VERIFIED
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/02-core-documentation/02-05-SUMMARY.md`
