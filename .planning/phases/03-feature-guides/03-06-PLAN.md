<objective>
Validate all Phase 3 feature guides for completeness, consistency, and accuracy, then get human approval.

Purpose: Before marking Phase 3 complete, verify that all 36 files (4 guides x 9 frameworks) exist, have zero placeholders, use correct framework patterns, and maintain structural consistency.

Output: Validation report and human approval of Phase 3 documentation.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Cross-validate all 36 feature guide files</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Run comprehensive validation across all Phase 3 deliverables:

**1. File existence check:**
For each of the 9 frameworks (jest, playwright, cypress, mocha, vitest, cucumberjs, newman, testcafe, wdio), verify 4 files exist:
- qase-{framework}/docs/ATTACHMENTS.md
- qase-{framework}/docs/STEPS.md
- qase-{framework}/docs/MULTI_PROJECT.md
- qase-{framework}/docs/UPGRADE.md

Report any missing files.

**2. Placeholder validation:**
Run `node .planning/tools/validate-placeholders.js` on all 36 files. Report any with unreplaced placeholders.

**3. Structural consistency check within guide types:**
For each guide type (ATTACHMENTS, STEPS, MULTI_PROJECT, UPGRADE), compare section headings across all 9 framework files:
- Extract H2 headings (## lines) from each file
- Verify all files of same type have matching section structure
- Newman and CucumberJS may have adapted structures - note these as acceptable variations

**4. Import statement accuracy:**
Verify each framework file uses the correct import:
- Jest: `jest-qase-reporter/jest`
- Playwright: `playwright-qase-reporter`
- Cypress: `cypress-qase-reporter/mocha`
- Mocha: `mocha-qase-reporter/mocha`
- Vitest: `vitest-qase-reporter`
- CucumberJS: N/A (Gherkin tags)
- Newman: N/A (collection-based)
- TestCafe: `testcafe-reporter-qase/qase`
- WDIO: `wdio-qase-reporter`

**5. Async/sync pattern check:**
- Async frameworks (Jest, Playwright, Vitest, TestCafe, WDIO): Should have `await` in step examples
- Sync frameworks (Cypress, Mocha): Should NOT have `await` in step examples
- CucumberJS/Newman: Should NOT have qase.step() examples

**6. See Also link validation:**
Check that all See Also sections link to existing files using correct relative paths.

**7. Generate validation report** summarizing:
- Total files: N/36
- Placeholder-free: N/36
- Structurally consistent: yes/no (with details)
- Import-correct: N/36
- Async/sync-correct: N/36
- Links valid: N/N
  </action>
  <verify>
Validation report generated with pass/fail for each check.
All critical checks pass (file existence, placeholder-free, import accuracy).
  </verify>
  <done>
Validation report confirms all 36 files exist, zero placeholders, correct imports, and structural consistency.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 2: Human review of Phase 3 feature guides</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Present the validation report to the user and request human review of Phase 3 feature guide documentation quality.

What was built in Phase 3:
- ATTACHMENTS.md: File/content/screenshot attachment patterns for all 9 frameworks
- STEPS.md: Test step definition, nesting, expected results for all 9 frameworks
- MULTI_PROJECT.md: Multi-project reporting configuration for all 9 frameworks
- UPGRADE.md: Version history and migration paths for all 9 frameworks

Total: 36 documentation files across Jest, Playwright, Cypress, Mocha, Vitest, CucumberJS, Newman, TestCafe, WDIO.

Request user to spot-check:
1. Review the validation report from Task 1 for any issues
2. Spot-check 2-3 frameworks for documentation quality:
   - Open `qase-playwright/docs/ATTACHMENTS.md` - verify screenshot example uses page.screenshot()
   - Open `qase-cypress/docs/STEPS.md` - verify sync pattern (no await)
   - Open `qase-newman/docs/STEPS.md` - verify limitations clearly stated
   - Open `qase-cypress/docs/UPGRADE.md` - verify v2->v3 migration documented
3. Check consistency: Compare section headings of any 2 ATTACHMENTS.md files from different frameworks
4. Verify See Also links render correctly in GitHub preview
  </action>
  <verify>User responds with "approved" or describes issues to fix.</verify>
  <done>Human reviewer approves Phase 3 documentation quality or provides actionable feedback.</done>
</task>
