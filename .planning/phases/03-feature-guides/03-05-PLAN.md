<objective>
Create UPGRADE.md guides for all 9 frameworks documenting version history and migration paths.

Purpose: Users need to know how to upgrade between reporter versions, what breaking changes exist, and what migration steps are needed. Most frameworks are on their first major version (no breaking changes), but accurate version numbers and future-proofed structure is essential.

Output: 9 UPGRADE.md files in respective qase-{framework}/docs/ directories, each with accurate version numbers from package.json and relevant migration information.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create UPGRADE.md for Jest, Playwright, and Cypress</name>
  <files>qase-jest/docs/UPGRADE.md, qase-playwright/docs/UPGRADE.md, qase-cypress/docs/UPGRADE.md</files>
  <action>
Apply UPGRADE-TEMPLATE.md to create upgrade guides. First, research version history for each framework.

**Research step (for each framework):**
1. Read `qase-{framework}/package.json` for current version
2. Run `git log --oneline qase-{framework}/ | head -30` to see recent changes
3. Check for CHANGELOG.md: `ls qase-{framework}/CHANGELOG.md` or `ls CHANGELOG.md`
4. Look for breaking changes: `git log --oneline --grep="breaking\|BREAKING\|migration\|upgrade" qase-{framework}/`

**Jest UPGRADE.md (current: 2.2.0):**
- {{CURRENT_VERSION}}: "2.2.0"
- Research if there was a v1.x. If yes, document v1 -> v2 migration (import path changes, config format changes). If no v1 existed, state: "jest-qase-reporter started with the v2.x architecture. No migration from a previous major version is required."
- Version History table: List known versions with dates (approximate from git log)
- Breaking Changes: Document any found from git log. If none, state: "No breaking changes between minor versions in the 2.x line."
- Configuration Changes: Document qase.config.json format (current standard)
- Import Changes: Show current import pattern `const { qase } = require('jest-qase-reporter/jest')`
- Compatibility: Node.js >= 14, Jest >= 27

**Playwright UPGRADE.md (current: 2.2.0):**
- {{CURRENT_VERSION}}: "2.2.0"
- Similar approach to Jest. Research v1 existence.
- Import: `import { qase } from 'playwright-qase-reporter'`
- Compatibility: Node.js >= 14, Playwright >= 1.16

**Cypress UPGRADE.md (current: 3.2.0):**
- {{CURRENT_VERSION}}: "3.2.0"
- IMPORTANT: Cypress is at v3.x which suggests a v2 -> v3 migration exists. This is the most content-rich upgrade guide.
- Research v2 -> v3 breaking changes thoroughly: `git log --oneline --grep="v3\|3.0\|breaking" qase-cypress/`
- Document v2.x -> v3.x migration steps including any:
  - Configuration format changes
  - Import path changes
  - Plugin setup changes (setupNodeEvents)
  - API changes
- If v3 migration info isn't clear from git, document what's known and add "For detailed v3.0 migration notes, see CHANGELOG."
- Compatibility: Node.js >= 14, Cypress >= 10

For all 3 files:
- Replace all placeholders with researched values
- If a section has no content (e.g., no renamed methods), use "No methods were renamed in this version." rather than leaving placeholders
- Troubleshooting: Include common issues like "Module not found after upgrade" and "Configuration format errors"
- Getting Help: Keep GitHub Issues link, CHANGELOG reference
- See Also: Link to usage.md, commons config reference
- Run `node .planning/tools/validate-placeholders.js` on each file
  </action>
  <verify>
Run validate-placeholders.js on all 3 files. All exit code 0.
Verify version numbers match package.json values.
Verify Cypress guide has v2->v3 migration content (it's at v3.2.0).
  </verify>
  <done>
Jest UPGRADE.md exists with version 2.2.0 and appropriate migration content.
Playwright UPGRADE.md exists with version 2.2.0 and appropriate migration content.
Cypress UPGRADE.md exists with version 3.2.0 and v2->v3 migration documented.
All files have zero unreplaced placeholders.

  <name>Task 2: Create UPGRADE.md for remaining 6 frameworks</name>
  <files>qase-mocha/docs/UPGRADE.md, qase-vitest/docs/UPGRADE.md, qase-cucumberjs/docs/UPGRADE.md, qase-newman/docs/UPGRADE.md, qase-testcafe/docs/UPGRADE.md, qase-wdio/docs/UPGRADE.md</files>
  <action>
Apply UPGRADE-TEMPLATE.md to create upgrade guides for the remaining 6 frameworks.

**Research step (for each framework):**
Same as Task 1: read package.json, git log, check for CHANGELOG and breaking changes.

**Mocha UPGRADE.md (current: 1.2.0):**
- First major version (1.x) - no prior migration
- State: "mocha-qase-reporter is currently in its first major version series (1.x). No migration from a previous major version is required."
- Document current version features and compatibility
- Compatibility: Node.js >= 14, Mocha >= 9

**Vitest UPGRADE.md (current: 1.1.0):**
- First major version (1.x) - no prior migration
- State: "vitest-qase-reporter is currently in its first major version series (1.x). No migration from a previous major version is required."
- Compatibility: Node.js >= 14, Vitest >= 0.25

**CucumberJS UPGRADE.md (current: 2.2.0):**
- Research if v1.x existed. Document appropriately.
- Note CucumberJS-specific: Gherkin tag format may have changed between versions
- Compatibility: Node.js >= 14, CucumberJS >= 7

**Newman UPGRADE.md (current: 2.2.0):**
- Research if v1.x existed. Document appropriately.
- Newman-specific: Reporter flag changes, collection format compatibility
- Compatibility: Node.js >= 14, Newman >= 5

**TestCafe UPGRADE.md (current: 2.2.0):**
- Research if v1.x existed. Document appropriately.
- TestCafe-specific: Builder pattern may have changed, meta() integration changes
- Compatibility: Node.js >= 14, TestCafe >= 2.0

**WDIO UPGRADE.md (current: 1.2.0):**
- First major version (1.x) - no prior migration
- State: "wdio-qase-reporter is currently in its first major version series (1.x). No migration from a previous major version is required."
- WDIO-specific: Note hook changes (beforeRunHook/afterRunHook), Cucumber integration changes
- Compatibility: Node.js >= 14, WebdriverIO >= 8.40

For all 6 files:
- For first-version frameworks (Mocha 1.x, Vitest 1.x, WDIO 1.x): Keep guide structure but with "No migration required" content. Include current version documentation and future-proof sections.
- For v2.x frameworks (CucumberJS, Newman, TestCafe): Research v1 existence and document migration if applicable.
- Use "N/A - No changes in this version" for empty table rows rather than leaving placeholders
- Run `node .planning/tools/validate-placeholders.js` on each file

Do NOT invent breaking changes that never happened. Do NOT speculate about future versions. Document only verified changes from git history and package.json.
