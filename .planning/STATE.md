# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-13)

**Core value:** Users can quickly understand and implement Qase reporter integration in their testing framework without confusion or missing information, regardless of which JavaScript testing framework they use.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation & Templates

## Current Position

Plan: 3 of 3 completed
Status: Phase 1 complete
Last activity: 2026-02-13 — Completed 01-03-PLAN.md: Template usage guide created and foundation verified

Progress: [████░░░░░░] 20%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Adapt Python templates rather than create new (proven structure, saves time)
- Keep documentation local in .planning/ (user preference)
- Cover all 9 reporters uniformly (consistent user experience)
- Use placeholder-based templates (enables future framework additions)
- Documentation stays in Markdown format (no VitePress/static site generators)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Use npm instead of pip for JavaScript package installation
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Support both CommonJS and ES modules syntax patterns
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Adapt Python templates structure rather than create new templates
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Use Node.js for validation script (native to ecosystem, no external dependencies)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Document all 9 frameworks in variations matrix (complete reference for template application)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Create comprehensive code style guide (ensures consistency, aligns with .prettierrc.json)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Create comprehensive 8-step workflow (detailed guidance for consistent template application)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Include framework-specific considerations section (highlights unique patterns for Jest, Playwright, Cypress)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Verify foundation through human checkpoint (ensures quality before Phase 2)
