## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Adapt Python templates rather than create new (proven structure, saves time)
- Keep documentation local in .planning/ (user preference)
- Cover all 9 reporters uniformly (consistent user experience)
- Use placeholder-based templates (enables future framework additions)
- Documentation stays in Markdown format (no VitePress/static site generators)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Use npm instead of pip for JavaScript package installation
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Support both CommonJS and ES modules syntax patterns
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Adapt Python templates structure rather than create new templates
