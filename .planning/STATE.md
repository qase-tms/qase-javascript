# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-13)

**Core value:** Users can quickly understand and implement Qase reporter integration in their testing framework without confusion or missing information, regardless of which JavaScript testing framework they use.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 - Core Documentation

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Adapt Python templates rather than create new (proven structure, saves time)
- Keep documentation local in .planning/ (user preference)
- Cover all 9 reporters uniformly (consistent user experience)
- Use placeholder-based templates (enables future framework additions)
- Documentation stays in Markdown format (no VitePress/static site generators)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Use npm instead of pip for JavaScript package installation
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Support both CommonJS and ES modules syntax patterns
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Adapt Python templates structure rather than create new templates
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Use Node.js for validation script (native to ecosystem, no external dependencies)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Document all 9 frameworks in variations matrix (complete reference for template application)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Create comprehensive code style guide (ensures consistency, aligns with .prettierrc.json)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Create comprehensive 8-step workflow (detailed guidance for consistent template application)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Include framework-specific considerations section (highlights unique patterns for Jest, Playwright, Cypress)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Verify foundation through human checkpoint (ensures quality before Phase 2)
- [Phase 02-core-documentation]: Use wrapper function pattern prominently in Jest examples
- [Phase 02-core-documentation]: Highlight Playwright's dual pattern (wrapper vs method-based)
- [Phase 02-core-documentation]: Include Integration Patterns section with framework-specific hooks
- [Phase 02-core-documentation]: Add Common Use Cases section with 5+ goal-oriented recipes
- [Phase 02-core-documentation]: Use TypeScript syntax for Playwright examples
- [Phase 02-core-documentation]: Use CommonJS syntax for Jest examples
- [Phase 02-core-documentation]: Document both native test.step() and qase.step() for Playwright
