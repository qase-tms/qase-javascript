# qase-wdio@1.0.0-beta.3

## What's new

- Fix an issue with `cucumber` steps. Now, the reporter will correctly handle the `cucumber` steps and will report them
  to the Qase TMS.
- Fix an issue with duplicate test runs. Now, the reporter will correctly handle the test runs and will not create
  duplicate test runs in the Qase TMS.

  You need to add `beforeRunHook` hook to the `onPrepare` and `afterRunHook` hook to the `onComplete` in the
  `wdio.conf.ts` configuration file:

  ```ts
    import type { Options } from '@wdio/types'
    import WDIOQaseReporter from "wdio-qase-reporter";
    import { afterRunHook, beforeRunHook } from "wdio-qase-reporter";

    export const config: Options.Testrunner = {
    // ...
    //
    // =====
    // Hooks
    // =====
    // WebdriverIO provides several hooks you can use to interfere with the test process in order to enhance
    // it and to build services around it. You can either apply a single function or an array of
    // methods to it. If one of them returns with a promise, WebdriverIO will wait until that promise got
    // resolved to continue.
    /**
     * Gets executed once before all workers get launched.
     * @param {object} config wdio configuration object
     * @param {Array.<Object>} capabilities list of capabilities details
     */
    onPrepare: async function() {
      await beforeRunHook();
    },

    /**
     * Gets executed after all workers got shut down and the process is about to exit. An error
     * thrown in the onComplete hook will result in the test run failing.
     * @param {object} exitCode 0 - success, 1 - fail
     * @param {object} config wdio configuration object
     * @param {Array.<Object>} capabilities list of capabilities details
     * @param {<Object>} results object containing test results
     */
    onComplete: async function() {
      await afterRunHook();
    },
  }
  ```
